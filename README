SYNOPSIS
     use Lingua::EN::Number::Format::MixWithWords qw(format_number_mix);

     print format_number_mix(num => 1.23e7); # prints "12.3 million"

DESCRIPTION
    This module formats number with English names of large numbers
    (thousands, millions, billions, and so on), e.g. 1.23e7 becomes "12.3
    million". If number is too small or too large so it does not have any
    appropriate names, it will be formatted like a normal number.

        The input number to format.

    *   num_decimal => *int*

        Number of decimal points to round.

        and so on.

        Pick long or short scale names.
